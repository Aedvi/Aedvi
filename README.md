# Hello There, 

![Pixel Sky Banner](assets/banner.png)

Hi, I'm Aedvi. I'm passionate about development, automation, and cybersecurity.

I have over 10 years of professional experience. I've lost access to my GitHub account three times due to mishandling MFA tokens. You're currently reading what is probably my fourth attempt at catching up with technology while managing a full-time job.

I've worked in many security-related fields, including program management, public policy, technical sales, security engineering, and software engineering.

For the past five years, I've been working at Amazon, where I developed a strong interest in the security of large language models (LLMs) — both securing the models themselves and exploring how they can enhance and accelerate security automation.

I'm also active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaume-neau-69aaa2109/) — feel free to connect.
